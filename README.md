Jira Clone is a ticket generator app, which generates every new ticket with unique ticket-id.
It performs mainly two actions : create and delete
1. Create : It creates new ticket as per requirement
2. Delete : As the name suggests, delete mode deletes tickets whenever required.

Jira Clone provides 4 different colors to mark the difference between tickets, which also helps in sorting tickets.
